# NeuralNetworkFootball
 neural network for the prediction of match winner in football world-cup
youu will understand  neural network layers , applying forward and backward propagation using activation function and gradient descent respectively.
hidden layers,
initalising random weights,
Activation function design: tanh for hidden layer, sigmoid - output layer.
prepare data : pandas and numpy

This code is developed for binary classification,
Tested on house availabilty data set, titanic dataset ,football predictions
